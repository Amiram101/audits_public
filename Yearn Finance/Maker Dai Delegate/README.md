# Maker Dai Delegate Security Audit Report (merged)

###### tags: `Yearn`

## Introduction

### Project overview
The maker DAI delegate project is Yearn vault strategy to earn a profit investing non-DAI ERC20 token into Yearn DAI vault without swapping non-DAI to DAI by using non-DAI as a collateral for minting DAI.

Like other Yearn strategies, the implementation consists of the base class `BaseStrategy` extended by custom logic `Strategy`, implemented in `BaseStrategy.sol` and `Strategy.sol`, respectively. 

The strategy maintains changes of collateral price to invest as much DAI as possible to avoid liquidation risks.

### Scope of the Audit
The scope of the audit includes the following smart contracts at:

## Security Assessment Methodology

A group of auditors are involved in the work on the audit who check the provided source code independently of each other in accordance with the methodology described below:

### 1. Project architecture review.

* Reviewing project documentation.
* General code review.
* Reverse research and study of the architecture of the code based on the source code only.
* Mockup prototyping.

```
Stage goals:
* Building an independent view of the project's architecture and identifying logical flaws in the code.
```

### 2. Checking the code against the checklist of known vulnerabilities.

* Manual code check for vulnerabilities from the company's internal checklist.
* The company's checklist is constantly updated based on the analysis of hacks, research and audit of the clientsâ€™ code.
* Checking with static analyzers (i.e Slither, Mythril, etc).

```
Stage goal: 
Eliminate typical vulnerabilities (e.g. reentrancy, gas limit, flashloan attacks etc.)
```

### 3. Checking the code for compliance with the desired security model.

* Detailed study of the project documentation.
* Examining contracts tests.
* Examining comments in code.
* Comparison of the desired model obtained during the study with the reversed view obtained during the blind audit.
* Exploits PoC development using brownie.

```
Stage goal: 
Detection of inconsistencies with the desired model
```


### 4. Consolidation of interim auditor reports into general one.

* Cross check: each auditor reviews the reports of the others.
* Discussion of the found issues by the auditors.
* Formation of a general (merged) report.

```
Stage goals: 
* Re-check all the problems for relevance and correctness of the threat level
* Provide the client with an interim report
```

### 5. Bug fixing & re-check.
* Client fixes or comments on every issue.
* Upon completion of the bug fixing, the auditors double-check each fix and set the statuses with a link to the fix.
* Additional verification of the entire initial project scope and code base.

```
Stage goal:
Preparation of the final code version with all the fixes and additional re-check
```

### 6. Preparation of the final audit report and delivery to the customer.


## Findings Severity breakdown

### Classification of Issues

* CRITICAL: Bugs leading to assets theft, fund access locking, or any other loss funds to be transferred to any party. 
* MAJOR: Bugs that can trigger a contract failure. Further recovery is possible only by manual modification of the contract state or replacement.
* WARNINGS: Bugs that can break the intended contract logic or expose it to DoS attacks. 
* COMMENTS: Other issues and recommendations reported to/ acknowledged by the team.

Based on the feedback received from the Customer's team regarding the list of findings discovered by the Contractor, they are assigned the following statuses:

### Findings' breakdown status

* FIXED: Recommended fixes have been made to the project code and no longer affect its security.
* ACKNOWLEDGED: The project team is aware of this finding. Recommendations for this finding are planned to be resolved in the future. This finding does not affect the overall safety of the project.
* NO ISSUE: Finding does not affect the overall safety of the project and does not violate the logic of its work
* NEW: Waiting for project team's feedback on the finding discovered  


## Report

### CRITICAL
Not found

### MAJOR
#### 1. Improper handling of losses in Yearn DAI vault
##### Description
The strategy is using another Yearn vault to invest DAI to take profit from it. In some rare conditions, that vault can suffer losses. Such conditions are not properly handled.

1. At the [prepareReturn](https://github.com/therealmonoloco/maker-dai-delegate/blob/97949a51062df956fd0172b7b1c778f66844b634/contracts/Strategy.sol#L303) the strategy is not reporting losses from `DAI yVault` until it is completely unable to conceal. As a result, losses are not fairly distributed between vault users. Some users may suffer unfair penalty on withdraw.
2. At the [liquidatePosition](https://github.com/therealmonoloco/maker-dai-delegate/blob/97949a51062df956fd0172b7b1c778f66844b634/contracts/Strategy.sol#L407) in some conditions, the strategy can overreport losses while it still has enought assets to complete the liquidation request by rebalancing `DAI` debt/collaterial at the `Maker vault`.
3. The losses in `DAI yVault` are never fixed, so even newcoming investors will not be able to take a profit until recent losses are compensated. On large losses it can take years to recover.
##### Recommendation
It is recommended to implement manual function to fix losses at `DAI yVault`:
1. To report losses to the parent vault
2. To rebalance debt/collaterial at Maker vault to make DAI debt equals to DAI balance available to the strategy

In some rare conditions, the option to flash-borrow WANT tokens from "the fixer" can be required to proceed rebalance during a liquidity shortage.
##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Client's commentary
> 1. This is a design decision we take for debt-based strategies. Losses are not reported as they go but only at the time they are realized.
> 2. This can still be handled by governance by granting CDP managing rights to itself with grantCdpManagingRightsToUser - which would allow raw / direct access to the CDP (repay debt, free collateral), or doing a WANT airdrop to the strategy
> 3. On extreme scenarios with unrecoverable losses we will most likely migrate to a new vault or amend losses by creating additional profit via an airdrop to the strategy

#### 2. Strategy migration reverts after Maker liquidation
##### Description
Unlikely, but possible situation when `Maker` collateral will be liquidated. In this case all operations with collateral will be reverted because the owner would be changed. After the liquidation you can't migrate to a new strategy because `prepareMigration` will be reverted for the above reasons.

https://github.com/therealmonoloco/maker-dai-delegate/blob/97949a51062df956fd0172b7b1c778f66844b634/contracts/Strategy.sol#L450

##### Recommendation
The `Maker`'s contract does not provide any functionality for getting the collateral's owner by cdpId (for checking that the liquidation didn't happen). That's why you have to cautch all exceptions of transferCdp call by using try/catch functionality in Solidity (0.6 and higher) and check the security modifier error. 

##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Client's commentary
Remaining yvDAI shares can be easily migrated by governance using `migrateToNewDaiYVault` function

### WARNINGS

Not found

### COMMENTS
#### 1. Unnecessary assert on immutable variable
##### Description
Assertion `address(investmentToken) != address(want)` in `_buyInvestmentTokenWithWant` is not necessary during contract execution

https://github.com/therealmonoloco/maker-dai-delegate/blob/97949a51062df956fd0172b7b1c778f66844b634/contracts/Strategy.sol#L855
##### Recommendation
It is recommended to make this assertion in `initialize` function
##### Status
Acknowledged
##### Client's commentary
Reason to keep first one as-is is mostly due to shared code between debt-based strategies and preventing introduction of bugs in case another strategist copy-pastes for a strategy that needs the additional check.

#### 2. Gas optimization in `_convertInvestmentTokenToWant`
##### Description
Two of three calls to `_convertInvestmentTokenToWant` can be saved at [`estimatedTotalAssets`](https://github.com/therealmonoloco/maker-dai-delegate/blob/97949a51062df956fd0172b7b1c778f66844b634/contracts/Strategy.sol#L282) by regrouping the add/mul operations.
##### Recommendation
We recommend to regroup the add/mul operations.
##### Status
Acknowledged

### Conclusion
During the audit process, several smart contracts and its interaction were examined. In some extremely rare conditions, several issues may potentially occur. These issues can be fixed by manual intervention of the Yearn Governance and may not lead to permanent losses of users' funds.

Assuming the Yearn Governance is trusted, no potential risks for users' funds were found.
